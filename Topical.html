                <h2 class="title_topical">Task 1</h2>
                <p>We brainstormed many ideas and chose the three that seemed the most interesting:
                First persona: A 23-year-old girl living in Norway with a Vietnamese background and
                a bachelor's degree in pharmacy. She has a slight hearing disability.
                Second persona: A 17-year-old Pakistani boy who lives in the UK with no disabilities
                and goes to high school.
                Third persona: A 20-year-old girl who comes from a small village in Russia, and
                moved to Norway, now ready for her bachelor's degree. She does not have an arm.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="grid_topical item3">
                <h2 class="title_topical">Task 2</h2>
                <p>We chose the 20-year-old Russian girl from a small village. Her name is Elena, she
                is an only child living with her mother. Her mother was working two jobs while taking
                care of her. She never really had a relationship with her father. Elena was a curious
                girl, and was really happy when her mother got married to a Norwegian man and
                they both moved to Norway. Because she was bullied in school for her missing arm,
                she could now start fresh. On a day-to-day basis in Norway, Elena goes to her
                lectures, goes to physical therapy, and goes to courses for both Norwegian and
                English.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="grid_topical item4">
                <h2 class="title_topical">Task 3</h2>
                <p>The technology we chose is the electrical scooters that we see on the side of the
                roads. Coming from a small village with little to no modern technological
                improvement, these scooters are new to our persona. First obstacle she would face
                is finding out that she needs an app to access the scooter. Since she doesn't know
                any English, it would be an issue to use the app.</p>
               
                <p>Going further, she would have issues figuring out how to work the app, what a
                QR-code is or does, what does a parking zone mean, how to add a card and so on.
                Another related challenge would be how to get the scooter going, what is the gas
                button, what are other buttons for, and so on. That is, if she understood the app.</p>
               
                <p>Further, considering her disability, we see that the gas button is only accessible on
                one side of the handlebar. Another challenge is the break. The brake handle is a bit
                far away from reaching easily, breaking with one hand would be hard and could lead
                to crashing, especially if driving at high speed.</p>
 
                <p>Another aspect is the handlebar itself. It has a standard height, and considering everyone has a different height,
                  our persona as well, it would be an issue of safety.
                  A few of them don't provide as good and smooth rides, with the steering being unsteady.
                  For someone with one arm, it would be even more dangerous and harder to keep balance.
                  Another issue is the scooter's weight. It is generally heavy to lift, for example when crossing a fort, or parking it. Even more difficult with one hand.
