            <h1>Accessibility page</h1>
            <p>To begin with we checked our code on <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">validator</a> to see if we may have missed any closings.</p>
            
            <p>We as a group have worked together to make a site that is easy, smooth, and simple for the reader 
                to get the information needed and at times see it visually with pictures.
            </p>
            
            <p> We chose strong contrasts between font colors, background colors, and a big enough font-size 
                in order to make the text stand out as well as being aesthetically pleasing. 
                Further we have a sticky navigation bar and a "book your table button", available on all 
                pages at all times. The button serves as an easy access for anyone to book the table faster without 
                having to figure out what and where to look in order to get a booking form. 
                The navigation bar makes it easier in general to have a good overview of our site. 
                Our booking forms have a hover effect, to make it clear which input box is in use at that moment. 
                The filling forms do not have a time limit, considering that some people might need more time to type. 
            </p>
            
            <p>On the homepage we chose to have a hover effect on buttons as well as a black border around to make it stand out. 
                We used grid on homepage, menu and topical to make the content look more put together and easy to navigate around.
                We checked that the tab button worked as it should, so that it tabbed through in the right order, something that is 
                important for those who don't use a mouse or a touchpad for any reason.
                On the menu page we have icons for vegetarian meals, to make it more noticeable. For allergies we have put together a thicker font, 
                different color, and a different background color for a more clear distinction between the allergy part and the rest of the page.
            </p>

            <p> We did a test using the website <a href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter">Colorblind Web Page Filter</a> to check that 
                anybody with colorblind disabilities can navigate through our site easily.
            </p>
